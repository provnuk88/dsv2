# Access Keys

Bots uses access keys to grant participation in events. Admins can create events with pre-generated access keys. When a user registers, one key is assigned and marked as distributed.

Keys can be manually added to an event document in MongoDB or uploaded via CSV.

This feature can be integrated with NFT or wallet verification services to bind keys to blockchain assets.
